# dApp IPFS My Picture Day 2021 ðŸ“¸
------------------------

We have an image that we will download to the browser using the form
front side. The file will go to ipfs each time the form is submitted. Once ipfs
the file will return to the browser with a hash. This hash will then be stored
on the blockchain. When we reload the app, we retrieve this hash.
This is how the browser will load the Hashday and retrieve the data from the
blockchain.
